# Color Collector
## Overview
The colored orbs will unlock objects of the same color to help you through the level. 
White orbs remove all the orbs you have collected. 
Arrows will flip you to the direction they are pointing. 
Enemies, I wonder what those could do?

Use the "a" and "d" keys move left and right. 
As well as using the spacebar to jump. 
You can double-jump as well.
